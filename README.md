This is a **recipe discovery application**. This project was created as part of [The Complete Javascript Course  2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) by *Jonas Schmedtmann*.

The majority of the HTML/SASS foundation was developed by the course instructor. The Javascript was written by me alongside the instructor as part of the course.

## Test out the application!

- Try searching for a single food-related keyword in the search bar at the top (e.g. 'avocado' or 'pasta')
- Try bookmarking a recipe by clicking the bookmark button on the currently selected recipe
- Try adjusting the number of servings using the buttons on either side of the display
- Try uploading your own custom recipe using the add recipe button
- Try reloading the page and checking that your bookmarks are preserved

### This application features the following:

- **MVC (Model-View-Controller) Architecture** -- allows for improved code organization and easier scalability and maintainability
- **Parcel** -- used to bundle the application together and to allow for compatibility with older browsers while utilizing modern Javascript features
- **Object Oriented Programming** -- used to implement the *View* logic
- **Functional Programming** -- loosely used for the model and controller logic
- **API Calls** -- recipes are loaded from a custom API made by the course instructor

### Features I implemented independently:

- I will be adding a total pages between the pagination buttons
- I will also be improving the uploading form so that input validation is done in real time
